He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”.";[I appreciate some people´s occasional habit of using P for person in shared stories.

Might have to practice writing it a few times."

(Imagine an old man with a walking stick creeping along a span of road, and you, in a car, whizzing right by him. It´s funny ´cause it´s true.) Also, it´s important to include the word ""through,"" so you know the walking stick goes right THROUGH the span."
